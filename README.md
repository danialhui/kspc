# Programming Challenge 

## Challenge A
**Write a program that will generate four (4) types of printable random objects and store them in a single file, each object will be separated by a ",". These are the 4 objects: alphabetical strings, real numbers, integers, alphanumerics. The alphanumerics should contain a random number of spaces before and after it (not exceeding 10 spaces). The output should be 10MB in size.**


**Answer:** [RandomObjectsGenerator.java](https://github.com/danialhui/kspc/blob/main/src/RandomObjectGenerator.java)

## Challenge B
**Create a program that will read the generated file above and print to the console the object and its type. Spaces before and after the alphanumeric object must be stripped.**


**Answer:** [ObjectsSorter.java](https://github.com/danialhui/kspc/blob/main/src/ObjectsSorter.java)

## Challenge C
**Dockerize Challenge B. Write a docker file so that it reads the output from Challenge A as an Input. Once this container is started, the program in challenge B is executed to process this file. The output should be saved in a file and should be exposed to the Docker host machine.**


**Answer:** [Dockerfile](https://github.com/danialhui/kspc/blob/main/Dockerfile)

### Build and Deploy
To build and deploy the program, execute
```
sh run.sh
```



### Generate Input
ObjectSorter is watching `data/in` directoty, to generate input, execute
```
java -classpath bin RandomObjectGenerator data/in/my_random_objects.txt
```

or use 
```
sh generateObjects.sh
```


### Cleanup
To clean up, execute

```
sh cleanup.sh
```
